# Project Roadmap and Tasks

## Remaining MVP Tasks

*   [ ] **Performance Tiering:** Implement a system to classify presets into performance tiers (e.g., low, medium, high) and allow the user to select a tier to match their device's capabilities.
*   [ ] **Preset Previews:** Generate and display thumbnail previews for each preset in the file picker.

## Stretch Goals (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Enhancement

*   [ ] **GPU Profiling:** Integrate a GPU profiler to measure the performance of each preset and provide real-time feedback to the user.
*   [ ] **User-Imported Presets:** Allow users to import their own MilkDrop presets from the device's storage.
*   [ ] **Debug Overlay:** Create a debug overlay that displays real-time performance metrics, such as FPS, CPU/GPU usage, and energy consumption.

### Phase 3: Intelligence

*   [ ] **AI-Powered Preset Selection:** Integrate a machine learning model to analyze the music being played and automatically select a preset that matches the genre, tempo, or mood.
*   [ ] **Visual Scoring and Classification:** Develop a system to score and classify the visual complexity and quality of presets.

### Phase 4: iOS Expansion

*   [ ] **iOS Port:** Translate the JNI bridge to Objective-C or Swift bindings to create an iOS version of the application.
*   [ ] **Metal/OpenGL ES Rendering:** Adapt the rendering pipeline to use Metal or OpenGL ES on iOS.
*   [ ] **iOS Audio Routing:** Investigate and implement a solution for capturing system audio on iOS, which has stricter limitations than Android.
